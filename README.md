## 👋 About Me & Focus

Hi, I'm Yogesh — a tech learner with a background in system administration, now focused on Cloud Computing and DevOps. I’m currently working on:

* Building practical skills in **AWS services** like EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS etc.  
* Learning **System Design** to architect scalable and reliable systems.  
* Contributing to **open-source** to gain real-world experience and collaborate with others.  
* Applying **Infrastructure as Code**, containerization, and CI/CD concepts in hands-on projects.

I’m passionate about automation, continuous learning, and simplifying complex systems.

### Cloud / DevOps:

* **[Mini Project 1: Multi-Pattern-Container-Deployment(Docker + Localstack)](https://github.com/YogeshT22/Multi-Pattern-Container-Deployment):**
    * This project demonstrates foundational DevOps principles by deploying an Nginx web server using three distinct, progressively complex patterns. It uses Docker, Docker Compose, Python, and LocalStack.
 
* **[Mini Project 2: Local Data Pipeline using Dockerized PostgreSQL/MySQL + Python]():**
    * A local data pipeline that uses Dockerized PostgreSQL or MySQL as the database backend and Python for data ingestion, transformation, and storage. The pipeline runs locally inside containers to simulate production-like workflows for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

* **[Scalable Web Application with CI/CD and Infrastructure as Code](Planned for future):**  
    * Build a multi-tier web app (e.g., React frontend + Node.js backend + MySQL or PostgreSQL database 

* **[Serverless Event-Driven Data Pipeline](Planned for future):**  
    * Created a serverless pipeline that ingests data, processes it, and stores the results

* **[Kubernetes-Based Microservices Application with Service Mesh and Auto-Scaling](Planned for future):**  
    * Develop a microservices app (e.g., simple e-commerce or task manager) composed of multiple containerized services communicating over a service mesh (using Istio).

### Android:

* **[Ammacare App](https://github.com/YogeshT22/Ammacare-Android-App.git):**  
  A personalized Android app to help mothers track daily routines and care tasks.
