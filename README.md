## üî≠ Future Plans/Tasks & OSS Contribution Goals

- Proactive outreach and consistent engagement -> increasing visibility.
- Contribute to documentation, testing, and CI setups for tools like **LocalStack**, **Ansible Collections**, and **Jenkins plugins**.
- Build and publish **reusable Ansible roles** and **Terraform modules** (e.g., NGINX server, S3 with lifecycle policies).
- Help small open-source projects adopt **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, or **Jenkins-based CI/CD** workflows.
- Actively triage bugs and participate in **GitHub discussions** to gain collaborative and issue-tracking experience.

    <details>
      <summary><em>Click to expand project description</em></summary><br>
      An Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project leveraging Ansible to automate the complete setup and configuration of a personal server.  
      This project demonstrates foundational skills in automation, idempotent server provisioning, and maintaining consistent system configurations, essential for scalable and repeatable deployments.
    </details>
  </li>

<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/YogeshT22/end-to-end-ci-cd-jenkins-docker">End-to-End CI/CD Platform (Kubernetes + Jenkins + Gitea + Docker)</a></strong><br>
  <details>
    <summary><em>Click to expand project description</em></summary><br>
    Built a production-grade, end-to-end CI/CD platform with full DevOps lifecycle automation.  
    Utilized Kubernetes (K3s) for container orchestration, Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines, Gitea for self-hosted GitOps, Docker for containerization, and a local Docker registry for image management. Prometheus/Grafana for observability.  
    The system automates code build, test, scan, and deployment to a live Kubernetes cluster via webhook triggers and Helm charts.  
    <br><br>
    <strong>Tools & Tech:</strong> Terraform, K3s, Jenkins, Gitea, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana, Helm  
    <br><br>

    <details>
      <summary><em>Click to expand project description</em></summary><br>
      This project demonstrates foundational DevOps principles by deploying an Nginx web server using three distinct, progressively complex patterns.  
      It uses Docker, Docker Compose, Python, and LocalStack.
    </details>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/YogeshT22/local-docker-data-pipeline">Mini Project 2: Containerized ETL Data Pipeline (PostgreSQL + Python)</a></strong><br>
    <details>
      <summary><em>Click to expand project description</em></summary><br>
      This project demonstrates a fundamental ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline pattern using Python and a PostgreSQL database,  
      all running as isolated services orchestrated by Docker Compose.  
      The key focus is on managing a stateful service (the database) and ensuring data persistence across container lifecycles using Docker Volumes.
