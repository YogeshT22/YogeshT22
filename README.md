## 👋 About Me & Focus

Hi, I'm Yogesh — a tech learner with a background in system administration, now focused on Cloud Computing and DevOps. I’m currently working on:

* Building practical skills in **AWS services** like EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS etc.  
* Learning **System Design** to architect scalable and reliable systems.  
* Contributing to **open-source** to gain real-world experience and collaborate with others.  
* Applying **Infrastructure as Code**, containerization, and CI/CD concepts in hands-on projects.

I’m passionate about automation, continuous learning, and simplifying complex systems.

## 🔭 Future Plans/Tasks & OSS Contribution Goals

- Contribute to documentation, testing, and CI setups for tools like **LocalStack**, **Ansible Collections**, and **Jenkins plugins**.
- Build and publish **reusable Ansible roles** and **Terraform modules** (e.g., NGINX server, S3 with lifecycle policies).
- Help small open-source projects adopt **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, or **Jenkins-based CI/CD** workflows.
- Actively triage bugs and participate in **GitHub discussions** to gain collaborative and issue-tracking experience.
- Improve security concerns in my existing projects.

### Cloud / DevOps:

* **[Mini Project 1: Multi-Pattern-Container-Deployment(Docker + Localstack)](https://github.com/YogeshT22/Multi-Pattern-Container-Deployment):**
    * This project demonstrates foundational DevOps principles by deploying an Nginx web server using three distinct, progressively complex patterns. It uses Docker, Docker Compose, Python, and LocalStack.
 
* **[Mini Project 2: Containerized ETL Data Pipeline (PostgreSQL + Python)](https://github.com/YogeshT22/local-docker-data-pipeline):**
    * This project demonstrates a fundamental ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline pattern using Python and a PostgreSQL database, all running as isolated services orchestrated by Docker Compose. The key focus is on managing a stateful service (the database) and ensuring data persistence across container lifecycles using Docker Volumes.

* **[Automated Personal Server Setup with Configuration Management (Ansible): (Focus: IaC fundamentals, automation, server config)](https://github.com/YogeshT22/project-1-ansible-server):**  
    * An Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project leveraging Ansible to automate the complete setup and configuration of a personal server. This project demonstrates foundational skills in automation, idempotent server provisioning, and maintaining consistent system configurations, essential for scalable and repeatable deployments.

* **[End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline (Gitea + Jenkins + Docker + Local Registry): (Focus: More complete CI/CD setup, popular tooling)](https://github.com/YogeshT22/end-to-end-ci-cd-jenkins-docker):**  
    * Developed and implemented a comprehensive end-to-end CI/CD pipeline integrating Gitea for version control, Jenkins for automation, Docker for containerization, and a local registry for image management. This project showcases practical experience in building robust development workflows, automating software delivery, and working with popular DevOps tools.
